/**
 * @brief The GA_FACTOR_LIST struct.
 *
 * Contains the list of distinct prime factors of a 64-bit unsigned integer, as
 * well as the powers of those factors.
 *
 * There can be at most 15 such distinct factors, since the product of the
 * first 16 primes (2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53) exceeds
 * the maximum unsigned number of 2^64-1. Moreover, there can be at most 63
 * factors all together, since 2^64 exceeds 2^64-1, so only an 8-bit number is
 * required to store the powers.
 *
 * The 15th (last) element of the factor list is always 0 and has power 0,
 * and serves as a sort of sentinel.

/**
 * @brief Factorize a positive integer into a list of factors satisfying
 * certain properties.
 *
 * The function factorizes a 64-bit, positive integer into a list of factors.
 * This factorization can be made "approximate"; That is, the product of the
 * factors returned can be slightly greater than the input number. The
 * maximum increase is controlled by a "slack" parameter maxN, as follows:
 *
 *     $$\texttt{n} \le \prod(\mathrm{fact}(\texttt{n}) \le \texttt{maxN}$$
 *
 * The advantage of offering some slack to the factorizer is that in return,
 * the factorizer may succeed in outputting a factorization with smaller
 * factors. The maxN slack parameter must be 0 or be greater than or equal to
 * n, but it is completely useless to set it beyond 2n.
 *
 * When maxN is equal to -1 (2^64 - 1), or is greater than or equal to 2n, no
 * upper limit is placed on the output factor list's product, but this
 * implementation guarantees its product will not exceed 2n. This is because
 * there always exists a power of two that lies between n and 2n, and since
 * this factorization involves only powers of the smallest prime (2), it is a
 * valid factorization under any valid k-smoothness constraint, and so may be
 * returned.
 *
 * When maxN is equal to 0 (no increase in value allowed), an exact factoring
 * is requested.
 *
 * The factorization can also be constrained by a (k)-smoothness constraint.
 * A k-smooth number n has no prime factors greater than k. If the factorizer
 * is asked to factor with k-smoothness a number with prime factors greater
 * than k, it will search, within the slack space, for a slightly larger
 * number that is k-smooth and return that number's factoring. With maxN == n
 * and a k-smoothness constraint, this function reports whether or not the
 * number is k-smooth.
 *
 * When k is equal to 0, equal to -1 (2^64 - 1), or is greater than or equal
 * to n, no k-smoothness constraints are imposed. An exact factoring is
 * required.
 *
 * @param [in]  n       The integer to be factorized. Must be >0.
 * @param [in]  maxN    The "slack" parameter. The factor list returned will
 *                      not have a product that exceeds this number.
 * @param [in]  k       The k-smoothness constraint. k is the largest
 *                      acceptable factor in the output factor list. The
 *                      factorizer will, effectively, treat any number all of
 *                      whose prime factors exceed k as a prime.
 * @param [out] fl      The output factor list. Does *NOT* need to be
 *                      initialized.
 * @return Non-zero if a factorization is found that satisfies both slack and
 *         smoothness constraints; Zero if no such factorization is found.
 *         If this function returns zero, the last factor in the factor
 *         list is not guaranteed to be prime.
